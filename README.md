TensorLayer is a novel TensorFlow-based deep learning and reinforcement learning library designed for researchers and engineers. It provides a large collection of customizable neural layers / functions that are key to build real-world AI applications. TensorLayer is awarded the 2017 Best Open Source Software by the [ACM Multimedia Society](https://twitter.com/ImperialDSI/status/923928895325442049).


# Features

As deep learning practitioners, we have been looking for a library that can address various development
 purposes. This library is easy to adopt by providing diverse examples, tutorials and pre-trained models.
Also, it allow users to easily fine-tune TensorFlow; while being suitable for production deployment. TensorLayer aims to satisfy all these purposes. It has three key features:

- ***Simplicity*** : TensorLayer lifts the low-level dataflow interface of TensorFlow to *high-level* layers / models. It is very easy to learn through the rich [example codes](https://github.com/tensorlayer/awesome-tensorlayer) contributed by a wide community.
- ***Flexibility*** : TensorLayer APIs are transparent: it does not mask TensorFlow from users; but leaving massive hooks that help *low-level tuning* and *deep customization*.
- ***Zero-cost Abstraction*** : TensorLayer can achieve the *full power* of TensorFlow. The following table shows the training speeds of [VGG16](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/) using TensorLayer and native TensorFlow on a TITAN Xp.

TensorLayer stands at a unique spot in the library landscape. Other wrapper libraries like Keras and TFLearn also provide high-level abstractions. They, however, often
hide the underlying engine from users, which make them hard to customize
and fine-tune. On the contrary, TensorLayer APIs are generally lightweight, flexible and transparent.
Users often find it easy to start with the examples and tutorials, and then dive
into TensorFlow seamlessly. In addition, TensorLayer does not create library lock-in through native supports for importing components from Keras.

TensorLayer has a fast growing usage among top researchers and engineers, from universities like Peking University,
Imperial College London, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University, and
University of Technology of Compiegne (UTC), and companies like Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi, and Bloomberg.

# Install


For latest code for TensorLayer 2.0, please build from the source. TensorLayer 2.0 has pre-requisites including TensorFlow 2, numpy, and others. For GPU support, CUDA and cuDNN are required.


Install the stable version:

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
pip3 install tensorlayer
```

Install the latest version:

```bash
pip3 install https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/archive/master.zip
```

If you want install TensorLayer 1.X, the simplest way to install TensorLayer 1.X is to use the **Py**thon **P**ackage **I**ndex (PyPI):

```bash
# for last stable version of TensorLayer 1.X
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer==1.X

# for latest release candidate of TensorLayer 1.X
pip3 install --upgrade --pre tensorlayer

# if you want to install the additional dependencies, you can also run
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer[all]              # all additional dependencies
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer[extra]            # only the `extra` dependencies
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer[contrib_loggers]  # only the `contrib_loggers` dependencies
```
<!---
Alternatively, you can install the latest or development version by directly pulling from github:

```bash
pip3 install https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/archive/master.zip
# or
# pip3 install https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/archive/<branch-name>.zip
```

## Using Docker

The [TensorLayer containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/) are built on top of the official [TensorFlow containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/):

### Containers with CPU support

```bash
# for CPU version and Python 2
docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -e PASSWORD=JUPYTER_NB_PASSWORD tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest

# for CPU version and Python 3
docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-py3
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -e PASSWORD=JUPYTER_NB_PASSWORD tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-py3
```

### Containers with GPU support

NVIDIA-Docker is required for these containers to work: [Project Link](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

```bash
# for GPU version and Python 2

docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-gpu-py3
nvidia-docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -e PASSWORD=JUPYTER_NB_PASSWORD tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-gpu-py3
```
