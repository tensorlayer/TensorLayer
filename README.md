[TensorLayer](https://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io) is a novel TensorFlow-based deep learning and reinforcement learning library designed for researchers and engineers. It provides an extensive collection of customizable neural layers to build complex AI models. TensorLayer is awarded the 2017 Best Open Source Software by the [ACM Multimedia Society](https://twitter.com/ImperialDSI/status/923928895325442049). 
TensorLayer can also be found at [iHub](https://code.ihub.org.cn/projects/328) and [Gitee](https://gitee.com/organizations/TensorLayer).

# Design Features

TensorLayer is a new deep learning library designed with simplicity, flexibility and high-performance in mind.

- ***Simplicity*** : TensorLayer has a high-level layer/model abstraction which is effortless to learn. You can learn how deep learning can benefit your AI tasks in minutes through the massive [examples](https://github.com/tensorlayer/awesome-tensorlayer).
- ***Flexibility*** : TensorLayer APIs are transparent and flexible, inspired by the emerging PyTorch library. Compared to the Keras abstraction, TensorLayer makes it much easier to build and train complex AI models.
- ***Zero-cost Abstraction*** : Though simple to use, TensorLayer does not require you to make any compromise in the performance of TensorFlow (Check the following benchmark section for more details).

TensorLayer stands at a unique spot in the TensorFlow wrappers. Other wrappers like Keras and TFLearn
hide many powerful features of TensorFlow and provide little support for writing custom AI models. Inspired by PyTorch, TensorLayer APIs are simple, flexible and Pythonic,
making it easy to learn while being flexible enough to cope with complex AI tasks.
TensorLayer has a fast-growing community. It has been used by researchers and engineers all over the world, including those from  Peking University,
Imperial College London, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University, and companies like Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi, and Bloomberg.

# Multilingual Documents

TensorLayer has extensive documentation for both beginners and professionals. The documentation is available in
both English and Chinese.

# Getting Start

TensorLayer 2.0 relies on TensorFlow, numpy, and others. To use GPUs, CUDA and cuDNN are required.

Install TensorFlow:

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-rc1 # TensorFlow GPU (version 2.0 RC1)
pip3 install tensorflow # CPU version
```

Install the stable release of TensorLayer:

```bash
pip3 install tensorlayer
```

Install the unstable development version of TensorLayer:

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer.git
```

If you want to install the additional dependencies, you can also run
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer[all]              # all additional dependencies
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer[extra]            # only the `extra` dependencies
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer[contrib_loggers]  # only the `contrib_loggers` dependencies
```

If you are TensorFlow 1.X users, you can use TensorLayer 1.11.0:

```bash
# For last stable version of TensorLayer 1.X
pip3 install --upgrade tensorlayer==1.11.0
```

## Using Docker

The [TensorLayer containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/) are built on top of the official [TensorFlow containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/):

### Containers with CPU support

```bash
# for CPU version and Python 2
docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -e PASSWORD=JUPYTER_NB_PASSWORD tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest

# for CPU version and Python 3
docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-py3
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -e PASSWORD=JUPYTER_NB_PASSWORD tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-py3
```

### Containers with GPU support

NVIDIA-Docker is required for these containers to work: [Project Link](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

```bash
# for GPU version and Python 2
docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-gpu
nvidia-docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -e PASSWORD=JUPYTER_NB_PASSWORD tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-gpu

# for GPU version and Python 3
docker pull tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-gpu-py3
nvidia-docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -e PASSWORD=JUPYTER_NB_PASSWORD tensorlayer/tensorlayer:latest-gpu-py3
```
