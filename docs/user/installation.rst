============
Installation
============

TensorLayer has some prerequisites that need to be installed first, including
`TensorFlow`_ , numpy and matplotlib. For GPU
support CUDA and cuDNN are required.

If you run into any trouble, please check the `TensorFlow installation
instructions <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html>`_
which cover installing the TensorFlow for a range of operating systems including
Mac OX, Linux and Windows, or ask for help on `tensorlayer@gmail.com <tensorlayer@gmail.com>`_
or `FAQ <http://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/more.html>`_.



Step 1 : Install dependencies
=================================

TensorLayer is build on the top of Python-version TensorFlow, so please install
Python first.

.. note::
  We highly recommend python3 instead of python2 for the sake of future.

Python includes ``pip`` command for installing additional modules is recommended.
Besides, a `virtual environment
<http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/>`_
via ``virtualenv`` can help you to manage python packages.

Take Python3 on Ubuntu for example, to install Python includes ``pip``, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get install python3
  sudo apt-get install python3-pip
  sudo pip3 install virtualenv

To build a virtual environment and install dependencies into it, run the following commands:
(You can also skip to Step 3, automatically install the prerequisites by TensorLayer)

.. code-block:: bash

  virtualenv env
  env/bin/pip install matplotlib
  env/bin/pip install numpy
  env/bin/pip install scipy
  env/bin/pip install scikit-image

To check the installed packages, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  env/bin/pip list

After that, you can run python script by using the virtual python as follow.

.. code-block:: bash

  env/bin/python *.py




Step 2 : TensorFlow
=========================

The installation instructions of TensorFlow are written to be very detailed on `TensorFlow`_  website.
However, there are something need to be considered.
For example, `TensorFlow`_ officially
supports GPU acceleration for Linux, Mac OX and Windows at present.

.. warning::
  For ARM processor architecture, you need to install TensorFlow from source.



Step 3 : TensorLayer
=========================

The simplest way to install TensorLayer is as follow, it will also install the numpy and matplotlib automatically.

.. code-block:: bash

  [stable version] pip install tensorlayer
  [master version] pip install git+https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer.git

However, if you want to modify or extend TensorLayer, you can download the repository from
`Github`_ and install it as follow.

.. code-block:: bash

  cd to the root of the git tree
  pip install -e .

This command will run the ``setup.py`` to install TensorLayer. The ``-e`` reflects
editable, then you can edit the source code in ``tensorlayer`` folder, and ``import`` the edited
TensorLayer.


Step 4 : GPU support
==========================

Thanks to NVIDIA supports, training a fully connected network on a
GPU, which may be 10 to 20 times faster than training them on a CPU.
For convolutional network, may have 50 times faster.
This requires an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA and cuDNN support.


CUDA
----

The TensorFlow website also teach how to install the CUDA and cuDNN, please see
`TensorFlow GPU Support <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html#optional-install-cuda-gpus-on-linux>`_.

Download and install the latest CUDA is available from NVIDIA website:

 - `CUDA download and install <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_


..
  After installation, make sure ``/usr/local/cuda/bin`` is in your ``PATH`` (use ``echo #PATH`` to check), and
  ``nvcc --version`` works. Also ensure ``/usr/local/cuda/lib64`` is in your
  ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, so the CUDA libraries can be found.

If CUDA is set up correctly, the following command should print some GPU information on
the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -c "import tensorflow"


cuDNN
--------

Apart from CUDA, NVIDIA also provides a library for common neural network operations that especially
speeds up Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Again, it can be obtained from
NVIDIA after registering as a developer (it take a while):

Download and install the latest cuDNN is available from NVIDIA website:

 - `cuDNN download and install <https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn>`_


To install it, copy the ``*.h`` files to ``/usr/local/cuda/include`` and the
``lib*`` files to ``/usr/local/cuda/lib64``.

Windows User
==============

TensorLayer is built on the top of Python-version TensorFlow, so please install Python first.
Note：We highly recommend installing Anaconda. The lowest version requirements of Python is py35.

`Anaconda download <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_

GPU support
------------
Thanks to NVIDIA supports, training a fully connected network on a GPU, which may be 10 to 20 times faster than training them on a CPU. For convolutional network, may have 50 times faster. This requires an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA and cuDNN support.

1. Installing Microsoft Visual Studio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You should preinstall Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) before installing CUDA. The lowest version requirements is VS2010. We recommend installing VS2015 or VS2013. CUDA7.5 supports VS2010, VS2012 and VS2013. CUDA8.0 also supports VS2015.

2. Installing CUDA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download and install the latest CUDA is available from NVIDIA website:

`CUDA download <https://developer.nvidia.com/CUDA-downloads>`_

We do not recommend modifying the default installation directory.

3. Installing cuDNN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The NVIDIA CUDA® Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. Download and extract the latest cuDNN is available from NVIDIA website:

`cuDNN download <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN>`_

After extracting cuDNN, you will get three folders (bin, lib, include). Then these folders should be copied to CUDA installation. (The default installation directory is `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v8.0`)

Installing TensorLayer
------------------------
You can easily install Tensorlayer using pip in CMD：

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install tensorflow        #CPU version
  pip install tensorflow-gpu    #GPU version (GPU version and CPU version just choose one)
  pip install tensorlayer       #Install tensorlayer

Test
--------

Enter “python” in CMD. Then:

.. code-block:: bash

  import tensorlayer

If there is no error and the following output is displayed, the GPU version is successfully installed.

.. code-block:: bash

  successfully opened CUDA library cublas64_80.dll locally
  successfully opened CUDA library cuDNN64_5.dll locally
  successfully opened CUDA library cufft64_80.dll locally
  successfully opened CUDA library nvcuda.dll locally
  successfully opened CUDA library curand64_80.dll locally

If there is no error, the CPU version is successfully installed.





Issue
=======

If you get the following output when import tensorlayer, please read `FQA <http://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/more.html>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

  _tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
