Tutorials
=========

For deep learning, this tutorial will walk you through building handwritten
digits classifiers using the MNIST dataset, arguably the "Hello World" of neural
networks. For reinforcement learning, we will let computer learns to play Pong
game from the original screen inputs. For nature language processing, we start
from word embedding and then describe language modeling and machine
translation.

This tutorial includes all modularized implementation of Google TensorFlow Deep
Learning tutorial, so you could read TensorFlow Deep Learning tutorial at the same time
`[en] <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/index.html>`_ `[cn] <http://wiki.jikexueyuan.com/project/tensorflow-zh/>`_ .

.. note::
    For experts: Read the source code of ``InputLayer`` and ``DenseLayer``, you
    will understand how `TensorLayer`_ work. After that, we recommend you to read
    the codes on Github directly.


Before we start
===============

The tutorial assumes that you are somewhat familiar with neural networks and
TensorFlow (the library which `TensorLayer`_ is built on top of). You can try to learn
the basics of a neural network from the `Deeplearning Tutorial`_.

For a more slow-paced introduction to artificial neural networks, we recommend
`Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition`_ by Andrej Karpathy et
al., `Neural Networks and Deep Learning`_ by Michael Nielsen.

To learn more about TensorFlow, have a look at the `TensorFlow tutorial`_. You will not
need all of it, but a basic understanding of how TensorFlow works is required to be
able to use `TensorLayer`_. If you're new to TensorFlow, going through that tutorial.


TensorLayer is simple
=======================

The following code shows a simple example of TensorLayer, see ``tutorial_mnist_simple.py`` .
We provide a lot of simple functions （like ``fit()`` , ``test()`` ), however,
if you want to understand the details and be a machine learning expert, we suggest you to train the network by using the data iteration toolbox (``tl.iterate``) and
the TensorFlow's native API like ``sess.run()``, see `tutorial_mnist.py <https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/blob/master/example/tutorial_mnist.py>_` , `tutorial_mlp_dropout1.py <https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/blob/master/example/tutorial_mlp_dropout1.py>`_ and `tutorial_mlp_dropout2.py <https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/blob/master/example/tutorial_mlp_dropout2.py>_` for more details.

Run the MNIST example
=====================

.. _fig_0601:

.. image:: my_figs/mnist.jpeg
  :width: 100 %
  :align: center

In the first part of the tutorial, we will just run the MNIST example that's
included in the source distribution of `TensorLayer`_. The MNIST dataset contains 60000
handwritten digits that are commonly used for training various
image processing systems. Each digit is 28x28 pixels in size.

We assume that you have already run through the :ref:`installation`. If you
haven't done so already, get a copy of the source tree of TensorLayer, and navigate
to the folder in a terminal window. Enter the folder and run the ``tutorial_mnist.py``
example script:

.. code-block:: bash

  python tutorial_mnist.py

If everything is set up correctly, you will get an output like the following:

  main_test_cnn_layer()




Understand the MNIST example
============================

Let's now investigate what's needed to make that happen! To follow along, open
up the source code.


Preface
-------

The first thing you might notice is that besides TensorLayer, we also import numpy
and tensorflow:

.. code-block:: python

  import tensorflow as tf
  import tensorlayer as tl
  from tensorlayer.layers import set_keep
  import numpy as np
  import time


As we know, TensorLayer is built on top of TensorFlow, it is meant as a supplement helping
with some tasks, not as a replacement. You will always mix TensorLayer with some
vanilla TensorFlow code. The ``set_keep`` is used to access the placeholder of keeping probabilities
when using Denoising Autoencoder.


Loading data
------------

The first piece of code defines a function ``load_mnist_dataset()``. Its purpose is
to download the MNIST dataset (if it hasn't been downloaded yet) and return it
in the form of regular numpy arrays. There is no TensorLayer involved at all, so
for the purpose of this tutorial, we can regard it as:

.. code-block:: python

  X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test = \
                    tl.files.load_mnist_dataset(shape=(-1,784))

``X_train.shape`` is ``(50000, 784)``, to be interpreted as: 50,000
images and each image has 784 pixels. ``y_train.shape`` is simply ``(50000,)``, which is a vector the same
length of ``X_train`` giving an integer class label for each image -- namely,
the digit between 0 and 9 depicted in the image (according to the human
annotator who drew that digit).

For Convolutional Neural Network example, the MNIST can be load as 4D version as follow:

.. code-block:: python

  X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test = \
              tl.files.load_mnist_dataset(shape=(-1, 28, 28, 1))

``X_train.shape`` is ``(50000, 28, 28, 1)`` which represents 50,000 images with 1 channel, 28 rows and 28 columns each.
Channel one is because it is a grey scale image, every pixel has only one value.

Building the model
------------------

This is where TensorLayer steps in. It allows you to define an arbitrarily
structured neural network by creating and stacking or merging layers.
Since every layer knows its immediate incoming layers, the output layer (or
output layers) of a network double as a handle to the network as a whole, so
usually this is the only thing we will pass on to the rest of the code.

As mentioned above, ``tutorial_mnist.py`` supports four types of models, and we
implement that via easily exchangeable functions of the same interface.
First, we'll define a function that creates a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) of
a fixed architecture, explaining all the steps in detail. We'll then implement
a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), after that we will then stack all Denoising Autoencoder and
supervised fine-tune them. Finally, we'll show how to create a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In addition, a simple example for MNIST
dataset in ``tutorial_mnist_simple.py``, a CNN example for the CIFAR-10 dataset in
``tutorial_cifar10_tfrecord.py``.


Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
--------------------------------------

The first script, ``main_test_layers()``, creates an MLP of two hidden layers of
800 units each, followed by a softmax output layer of 10 units. It applies 20%
dropout to the input data and 50% dropout to the hidden layers.

To feed data into the network, TensofFlow placeholders need to be defined as follow.
The ``None`` here means the network will accept input data of arbitrary batch size after compilation.
The ``x`` is used to hold the ``X_train`` data and ``y_`` is used to hold the ``y_train`` data.
If you know the batch size beforehand and do not need this flexibility, you should give the batch size
here -- especially for convolutional layers, this can allow TensorFlow to apply
some optimizations.

.. code-block:: python

    x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784], name='x')
    y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=[None, ], name='y_')

The foundation of each neural network in TensorLayer is an
:class:`InputLayer <tensorlayer.layers.InputLayer>` instance
representing the input data that will subsequently be fed to the network. Note
that the ``InputLayer`` is not tied to any specific data yet.

.. code-block:: python

    network = tl.layers.InputLayer(x, name='input')

Before adding the first hidden layer, we'll apply 20% dropout to the input
data. This is realized via a :class:`DropoutLayer
<tensorlayer.layers.DropoutLayer>` instance:

.. code-block:: python

    network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=0.8, name='drop1')

Note that the first constructor argument is the incoming layer, the second
argument is the keeping probability for the activation value. Now we'll proceed
with the first fully-connected hidden layer of 800 units. Note
that when stacking a :class:`DenseLayer <tensorlayer.layers.DenseLayer>`.

.. code-block:: python

    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network, n_units=800, act = tf.nn.relu, name='relu1')

Again, the first constructor argument means that we're stacking ``network`` on
top of ``network``.
``n_units`` simply gives the number of units for this fully-connected layer.
``act`` takes an activation function, several of which are defined
in :mod:`tensorflow.nn` and `tensorlayer.activation`. Here we've chosen the rectifier, so
we'll obtain ReLUs. We'll now add dropout of 50%, another 800-unit dense layer and 50% dropout
again:

.. code-block:: python

    network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=0.5, name='drop2')
    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network, n_units=800, act = tf.nn.relu, name='relu2')
    network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=0.5, name='drop3')

Finally, we'll add the fully-connected output layer which the ``n_units`` equals to
the number of classes. Note that, the softmax is implemented internally in ``tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits()``
to speed up computation, so we used identity in the last layer, more
details in ``tl.cost.cross_entropy()``.


.. code-block:: python

    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network,
                                  n_units=10,
                                  act = tf.identity,
                                  name='output')

As mentioned above, each layer is linked to its incoming layer(s), so we only
need the output layer(s) to access a network in TensorLayer:

.. code-block:: python

    y = network.outputs
    y_op = tf.argmax(tf.nn.softmax(y), 1)
    cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(y, y_))

Here, ``network.outputs`` is the 10 identity outputs from the network (in one hot format), ``y_op`` is the integer
output represents the class index. While ``cost`` is the cross-entropy between the target and the predicted labels.

Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)
--------------------------------------

Autoencoder is an unsupervised learning model which is able to extract representative features,
it has become more widely used for learning generative models of data and Greedy layer-wise pre-train.
For vanilla Autoencoder, see `Deeplearning Tutorial`_.

The script ``main_test_denoise_AE()`` implements a Denoising Autoencoder with corrosion rate of 50%.
The Autoencoder can be defined as follow, where an Autoencoder is represented by a ``DenseLayer``:

.. code-block:: python

    network = tl.layers.InputLayer(x, name='input_layer')
    network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=0.5, name='denoising1')
    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network, n_units=200, act=tf.nn.sigmoid, name='sigmoid1')
    recon_layer1 = tl.layers.ReconLayer(network,
                                        x_recon=x,
                                        n_units=784,
                                        act=tf.nn.sigmoid,
                                        name='recon_layer1')

To train the ``DenseLayer``, simply run ``ReconLayer.pretrain()``, if using denoising Autoencoder, the name of
corrosion layer (a ``DropoutLayer``) need to be specified as follow. To save the feature images, set ``save`` to ``True``.
There are many kinds of pre-train metrices according to different architectures and applications. For sigmoid activation,
the Autoencoder can be implemented by using KL divergence, while for rectifier, L1 regularization of activation outputs
can make the output to be sparse. So the default behaviour of ``ReconLayer`` only provide KLD and cross-entropy for sigmoid
activation function and L1 of activation outputs and mean-squared-error for rectifying activation function.
We recommend you to modify ``ReconLayer`` to achieve your own pre-train metrice.

.. code-block:: python

    recon_layer1.pretrain(sess,
                          x=x,
                          X_train=X_train,
                          X_val=X_val,
                          denoise_name='denoising1',
                          n_epoch=200,
                          batch_size=128,
                          print_freq=10,
                          save=True,
                          save_name='w1pre_')

In addition, the script ``main_test_stacked_denoise_AE()`` shows how to stacked multiple Autoencoder to one network and then
fine-tune.


Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
--------------------------------------

Finally, the ``main_test_cnn_layer()`` script creates two CNN layers and
max pooling stages, a fully-connected hidden layer and a fully-connected output
layer. More CNN examples can be found in other examples, like ``tutorial_cifar10_tfrecord.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    network = tl.layers.Conv2d(network, 32, (5, 5), (1, 1),
            act=tf.nn.relu, padding='SAME', name='cnn1')
    network = tl.layers.MaxPool2d(network, (2, 2), (2, 2),
            padding='SAME', name='pool1')
    network = tl.layers.Conv2d(network, 64, (5, 5), (1, 1),
            act=tf.nn.relu, padding='SAME', name='cnn2')
    network = tl.layers.MaxPool2d(network, (2, 2), (2, 2),
            padding='SAME', name='pool2')

    network = tl.layers.FlattenLayer(network, name='flatten')
    network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=0.5, name='drop1')
    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network, 256, act=tf.nn.relu, name='relu1')
    network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=0.5, name='drop2')
    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network, 10, act=tf.identity, name='output')


Training the model
------------------

The remaining part of the ``tutorial_mnist.py`` script copes with setting up and running
a training loop over the MNIST dataset by using cross-entropy only.


Dataset iteration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An iteration function for synchronously iterating over two
numpy arrays of input data and targets, respectively, in mini-batches of a
given number of items. More iteration function can be found in ``tensorlayer.iterate``

.. code-block:: python

    tl.iterate.minibatches(inputs, targets, batchsize, shuffle=False)


Loss and update expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Continuing, we create a loss expression to be minimized in training:

.. code-block:: python

    y = network.outputs
    y_op = tf.argmax(tf.nn.softmax(y), 1)
    cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(y, y_))


More cost or regularization can be applied here.
For example, to apply max-norm on the weight matrices, we can add the following line.

.. code-block:: python

    cost = cost + tl.cost.maxnorm_regularizer(1.0)(network.all_params[0]) +
                  tl.cost.maxnorm_regularizer(1.0)(network.all_params[2])

Depending on the problem you are solving, you will need different loss functions,
see :mod:`tensorlayer.cost` for more.
Apart from using ``network.all_params`` to get the variables, we can also use ``tl.layers.get_variables_with_name`` to get the specific variables by string name.

Having the model and the loss function here, we create update expression/operation
for training the network. TensorLayer does not provide many optimizers, we used TensorFlow's
optimizer instead:

.. code-block:: python

    train_params = network.all_params
    train_op = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999,
        epsilon=1e-08, use_locking=False).minimize(cost, var_list=train_params)


For training the network, we fed data and the keeping probabilities to the ``feed_dict``.

.. code-block:: python

    feed_dict = {x: X_train_a, y_: y_train_a}
    feed_dict.update( network.all_drop )
    sess.run(train_op, feed_dict=feed_dict)

While, for validation and testing, we use slightly different way. All
Dropout, Dropconnect, Corrosion layers need to be disabled.
We use ``tl.utils.dict_to_one`` to set all ``network.all_drop`` to 1.

.. code-block:: python

    dp_dict = tl.utils.dict_to_one( network.all_drop )
    feed_dict = {x: X_test_a, y_: y_test_a}
    feed_dict.update(dp_dict)
    err, ac = sess.run([cost, acc], feed_dict=feed_dict)

For evaluation, we create an expression for the classification accuracy:

.. code-block:: python

    correct_prediction = tf.equal(tf.argmax(y, 1), y_)
    acc = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, tf.float32))


What Next?
^^^^^^^^^^^

We also have a more advanced image classification example in `tutorial_cifar10_tfrecord.py <https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/blob/master/example/tutorial_cifar10_tfrecord.py>`_.
Please read the code and notes, figure out how to generate more training data and what
is local response normalization. After that, try to implement
`Residual Network <http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00124>`_ (Hint: you may want
to use the Layer.outputs).





Run the Pong Game example
=========================

In the second part of the tutorial, we will run the Deep Reinforcement Learning
example which is introduced by Karpathy in `Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels <http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

  python tutorial_atari_pong.py

Before running the tutorial code, you need to install `OpenAI gym environment <https://gym.openai.com/docs>`_
which is a popular benchmark for Reinforcement Learning.
If everything is set up correctly, you will get an output like the following:

.. code-block:: text

This example allows the neural network to learn how to play Pong game from the screen inputs,
just like human behavior.
The neural network will play with a fake AI player and learn to beat it.
After training for 15,000 episodes, the neural network can
win 20% of the games. The neural network win 35% of the games at 20,000 episode,
we can seen the neural network learn faster and faster as it has more winning data to
train. If you run it for 30,000 episode, it never loss.

.. code-block:: python

  render = False
  resume = False

Setting ``render`` to ``True``, if you want to display the game environment. When
you run the code again, you can set ``resume`` to ``True``, the code will load the
existing model and train the model basic on it.

Understand Reinforcement learning
==================================

Pong Game
---------

To understand Reinforcement Learning, we let computer to learn how to play
Pong game from the original screen inputs. Before we start, we highly recommend
you to go through a famous blog called `Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels <http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/>`_
which is a minimalistic implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning by
using python-numpy and OpenAI gym environment.


.. code-block:: bash

  python tutorial_atari_pong.py



Policy Network
---------------

In Deep Reinforcement Learning, the Policy Network is the same with Deep Neural
Network, it is our player (or “agent”) who output actions to tell what we should
do (move UP or DOWN); in Karpathy's code, he only defined 2 actions, UP and DOWN
and using a single simgoid output;
In order to make our tutorial more generic, we defined 3 actions which are UP,
DOWN and STOP (do nothing) by using 3 softmax outputs.

.. code-block:: python

    # observation for training
    states_batch_pl = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, D])

    network = tl.layers.InputLayer(states_batch_pl, name='input_layer')
    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network, n_units=H,
                                    act = tf.nn.relu, name='relu1')
    network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network, n_units=3,
                            act = tf.identity, name='output_layer')
    probs = network.outputs
    sampling_prob = tf.nn.softmax(probs)

Then when our agent is playing Pong, it calculates the probabilities of different
actions, and then draw sample (action) from this uniform distribution. As the
actions are represented by 1, 2 and 3, but the softmax outputs should be start
from 0, we calculate the label value by minus 1.

.. code-block:: python

    prob = sess.run(
        sampling_prob,
        feed_dict={states_batch_pl: x}
    )
    # action. 1: STOP  2: UP  3: DOWN
    action = np.random.choice([1,2,3], p=prob.flatten())
    ...
    ys.append(action - 1)


Policy Gradient
---------------

Policy gradient methods are end-to-end algorithms that directly learn policy
functions mapping states to actions. An approximate policy could be learned
directly by maximizing the expected rewards. The parameters of a policy function
(e.g. the parameters of a policy network used in the pong example) could be
trained and learned under the guidance of the gradient of expected rewards.
In other words, we can gradually tune the policy function via updating its
parameters, such that it will generate actions from given states towards
higher rewards.

An alternative method to policy gradient is Deep Q-Learning (DQN). It is based
on Q-Learning that tries to learn a value function (called Q function) mapping
states and actions to some value. DQN employs a deep neural network to represent
the Q function as a function approximator. The training is done by minimizing
temporal-difference errors. A neurobiologically inspired mechanism called
“experience replay” is typically used along with DQN to help improve its
stability caused by the use of non-linear function approximator.

You can check the following papers to gain better understandings about Reinforcement Learning.

 - `Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto <https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html>`_
 - `Deep Reinforcement Learning. David Silver, Google DeepMind <http://www.iclr.cc/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=iclr2015:silver-iclr2015.pdf>`_
 - `UCL Course on RL <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>`_


The most successful applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning in recent years
include DQN with experience replay to play Atari games and AlphaGO
that for the first time beats world-class professional GO players.
AlphaGO used the policy gradient method to train its policy network that is
similar to the example of Pong game.

 - `Atari - Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf>`_
 - `Atari - Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html>`_
 - `AlphaGO - Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html>`_



Dataset iteration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Reinforcement Learning, we consider a final decision as an episode.
In Pong game, a episode is a few dozen games, because the games go up to score
of 21 for either player. Then the batch size is how many episode we consider
to update the model.
In the tutorial, we train a 2-layer policy network with 200 hidden layer units
using RMSProp on batches of 10 episodes.

Loss and update expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We create a loss expression to be minimized in training:

.. code-block:: python

    actions_batch_pl = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])
    discount_rewards_batch_pl = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None])
    loss = tl.rein.cross_entropy_reward_loss(probs, actions_batch_pl,
                                                  discount_rewards_batch_pl)
    ...
    ...
    sess.run(
        train_op,
        feed_dict={
            states_batch_pl: epx,
            actions_batch_pl: epy,
            discount_rewards_batch_pl: disR
        }
    )

The loss in a batch is relate to all outputs of Policy Network, all actions we
made and the corresponding discounted rewards in a batch. We first compute the
loss of each action by multiplying the discounted reward and the cross-entropy
between its output and its true action. The final loss in a batch is the sum of
all loss of the actions.


What Next?
-----------

The tutorial above shows how you can build your own agent, end-to-end.
While it has reasonable quality, the default parameters will not give you
the best agent model. Here are a few things you can improve.

First of all, instead of conventional MLP model, we can use CNNs to capture the
screen information better as `Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf>`_
describe.

Also, the default parameters of the model are not tuned. You can try changing
the learning rate, decay, or initializing the weights of your model in a
different way.

Finally, you can try the model on different tasks (games) and try other reinforcement learning algorithm in `Example <http://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/example.html>`_.







Run the Word2Vec example
=========================

In this part of the tutorial, we train a matrix for words, where each word can
be represented by a unique row vector in the matrix. In the end, similar words
will have similar vectors. Then as we plot out the words into a two-dimensional
plane, words that are similar end up clustering nearby each other.

.. code-block:: bash

  python tutorial_word2vec_basic.py


If everything is set up correctly, you will get an output in the end.

Understand Word Embedding
============================

Word Embedding
----------------

We highly recommend you to read Colah's blog `Word Representations`_ to
understand why we want to use a vector representation, and how to compute the
vectors. (For chinese reader please `click <http://dataunion.org/9331.html>`_.
More details about word2vec can be found in
`Word2vec Parameter Learning Explained <http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738>`_.




Bascially, training an embedding matrix is an unsupervised learning. As every word
is refected by an unique ID, which is the row index of the embedding matrix,
a word can be converted into a vector, it can better represent the meaning.
For example, there seems to be a constant male-female difference vector:
``woman − man = queen - king``, this means one dimension in the vector represents gender.


The model can be created as follow.

.. code-block:: python

  # train_inputs is a row vector, a input is an integer id of single word.
  # train_labels is a column vector, a label is an integer id of single word.
  # valid_dataset is a column vector, a valid set is an integer id of single word.
  train_inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[batch_size])
  train_labels = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[batch_size, 1])
  valid_dataset = tf.constant(valid_examples, dtype=tf.int32)

  # Look up embeddings for inputs.
  emb_net = tl.layers.Word2vecEmbeddingInputlayer(
          inputs = train_inputs,
          train_labels = train_labels,
          vocabulary_size = vocabulary_size,
          embedding_size = embedding_size,
          num_sampled = num_sampled,
          nce_loss_args = {},
          E_init = tf.random_uniform_initializer(minval=-1.0, maxval=1.0),
          E_init_args = {},
          nce_W_init = tf.truncated_normal_initializer(
                            stddev=float(1.0/np.sqrt(embedding_size))),
          nce_W_init_args = {},
          nce_b_init = tf.constant_initializer(value=0.0),
          nce_b_init_args = {},
          name ='word2vec_layer',
      )

Dataset iteration and loss
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Word2vec uses Negative Sampling and Skip-Gram model for training.
Noise-Contrastive Estimation Loss (NCE) can help to reduce the computation
of loss. Skip-Gram inverts context and targets, tries to predict each context
word from its target word. We use ``tl.nlp.generate_skip_gram_batch`` to
generate training data as follow, see ``tutorial_generate_text.py`` .

.. code-block:: python

  # NCE cost expression is provided by Word2vecEmbeddingInputlayer
  cost = emb_net.nce_cost
  train_params = emb_net.all_params

  train_op = tf.train.AdagradOptimizer(learning_rate, initial_accumulator_value=0.1,
            use_locking=False).minimize(cost, var_list=train_params)

  data_index = 0
  while (step < num_steps):
    batch_inputs, batch_labels, data_index = tl.nlp.generate_skip_gram_batch(
                  data=data, batch_size=batch_size, num_skips=num_skips,
                  skip_window=skip_window, data_index=data_index)
    feed_dict = {train_inputs : batch_inputs, train_labels : batch_labels}
    _, loss_val = sess.run([train_op, cost], feed_dict=feed_dict)


Restore existing Embedding matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the end of training the embedding matrix, we save the matrix and
corresponding dictionaries. Then next time, we can restore the matrix and
directories as follow.
(see ``main_restore_embedding_layer()`` in ``tutorial_generate_text.py``)

.. code-block:: python

  vocabulary_size = 50000
  embedding_size = 128
  model_file_name = "model_word2vec_50k_128"
  batch_size = None

  print("Load existing embedding matrix and dictionaries")
  all_var = tl.files.load_npy_to_any(name=model_file_name+'.npy')
  data = all_var['data']; count = all_var['count']
  dictionary = all_var['dictionary']
  reverse_dictionary = all_var['reverse_dictionary']

  tl.nlp.save_vocab(count, name='vocab_'+model_file_name+'.txt')

  del all_var, data, count

  load_params = tl.files.load_npz(name=model_file_name+'.npz')

  x = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[batch_size])
  y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[batch_size, 1])

  emb_net = tl.layers.EmbeddingInputlayer(
                  inputs = x,
                  vocabulary_size = vocabulary_size,
                  embedding_size = embedding_size,
                  name ='embedding_layer')

  tl.layers.initialize_global_variables(sess)

  tl.files.assign_params(sess, [load_params[0]], emb_net)




Run the PTB example
=========================

Penn TreeBank (PTB) dataset is used in many LANGUAGE MODELING papers,
including "Empirical Evaluation and Combination of Advanced Language
Modeling Techniques", "Recurrent Neural Network Regularization".
It consists of 929k training words, 73k validation words, and 82k test
words. It has 10k words in its vocabulary.

The PTB example is trying to show how to train a recurrent neural network on a
challenging task of language modeling.

Given a sentence "I am from Imperial College London", the model can learn to
predict "Imperial College London" from "from Imperial College". In other
word, it predict the next word in a text given a history of previous words.
In the previous example , ``num_steps`` (sequence length) is 3.

.. code-block:: bash

  python tutorial_ptb_lstm.py


The script provides three settings (small, medium, large), where a larger model has
better performance. You can choose different settings in:

.. code-block:: python

  flags.DEFINE_string(
      "model", "small",
      "A type of model. Possible options are: small, medium, large.")

If you choose the small setting, you can see:

.. code-block:: text

The PTB example shows that RNN is able to model language, but this example
did not do something practically interesting. However, you should read through this example
and “Understand LSTM” in order to understand the basics of RNN.
After that, you will learn how to generate text, how to achieve language translation,
and how to build a question answering system by using RNN.


Understand LSTM
==================

Recurrent Neural Network
-------------------------

We personally think Andrej Karpathy's blog is the best material to
`Understand Recurrent Neural Network`_ , after reading that, Colah's blog can
help you to `Understand LSTM Network`_ `[chinese] <http://dataunion.org/9331.html>`_
which can solve The Problem of Long-Term
Dependencies. We will not describe more about the theory of RNN, so please read through these blogs
before you go on.

.. image:: my_figs/karpathy_rnn.jpeg

Image by Andrej Karpathy


Synced sequence input and output
---------------------------------

The model in PTB example is a typical type of synced sequence input and output,
which was described by Karpathy as
"(5) Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish
to label each frame of the video). Notice that in every case there are no pre-specified
constraints on the lengths of sequences because the recurrent transformation (green)
can be applied as many times as we like."

The model is built as follows. Firstly, we transfer the words into word vectors by
looking up an embedding matrix. In this tutorial, there is no pre-training on the embedding
matrix. Secondly, we stack two LSTMs together using dropout between the embedding
layer, LSTM layers, and the output layer for regularization. In the final layer,
the model provides a sequence of softmax outputs.

The first LSTM layer outputs ``[batch_size, num_steps, hidden_size]`` for stacking
another LSTM after it. The second LSTM layer outputs ``[batch_size*num_steps, hidden_size]``
for stacking a DenseLayer after it. Then the DenseLayer computes the softmax outputs of each example
（``n_examples = batch_size*num_steps``).

To understand the PTB tutorial, you can also read `TensorFlow PTB tutorial
<https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/recurrent/index.html#recurrent-neural-networks>`_.

(Note that, TensorLayer supports DynamicRNNLayer after v1.1, so you can set the input/output dropouts, number of RNN layers in one single layer)


.. code-block:: python

  network = tl.layers.EmbeddingInputlayer(
              inputs = x,
              vocabulary_size = vocab_size,
              embedding_size = hidden_size,
              E_init = tf.random_uniform_initializer(-init_scale, init_scale),
              name ='embedding_layer')
  if is_training:
      network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=keep_prob, name='drop1')
  network = tl.layers.RNNLayer(network,
              cell_fn=tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell,
              cell_init_args={'forget_bias': 0.0},
              n_hidden=hidden_size,
              initializer=tf.random_uniform_initializer(-init_scale, init_scale),
              n_steps=num_steps,
              return_last=False,
              name='basic_lstm_layer1')
  lstm1 = network
  if is_training:
      network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=keep_prob, name='drop2')
  network = tl.layers.RNNLayer(network,
              cell_fn=tf.contrib.rnn.BasicLSTMCell,
              cell_init_args={'forget_bias': 0.0},
              n_hidden=hidden_size,
              initializer=tf.random_uniform_initializer(-init_scale, init_scale),
              n_steps=num_steps,
              return_last=False,
              return_seq_2d=True,
              name='basic_lstm_layer2')
  lstm2 = network
  if is_training:
      network = tl.layers.DropoutLayer(network, keep=keep_prob, name='drop3')
  network = tl.layers.DenseLayer(network,
              n_units=vocab_size,
              W_init=tf.random_uniform_initializer(-init_scale, init_scale),
              b_init=tf.random_uniform_initializer(-init_scale, init_scale),
              act = tf.identity, name='output_layer')


Dataset iteration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``batch_size`` can be seen as the number of concurrent computations we are running.
As the following example shows, the first batch learns the sequence information by using items 0 to 9.
The second batch learn the sequence information by using items 10 to 19.
So it ignores the information from items 9 to 10 !\n
If only if we set ``batch_size = 1```, it will consider all the information from items 0 to 20.

The meaning of ``batch_size`` here is not the same as the ``batch_size`` in the MNIST example. In the MNIST example,
``batch_size`` reflects how many examples we consider in each iteration, while in the
PTB example, ``batch_size`` is the number of concurrent processes (segments)
for accelerating the computation.

Some information will be ignored if ``batch_size`` > 1, however, if your dataset
is "long" enough (a text corpus usually has billions of words), the ignored
information would not affect the final result.

In the PTB tutorial, we set ``batch_size = 20``, so we divide the dataset into 20 segments.
At the beginning of each epoch, we initialize (reset) the 20 RNN states for the 20
segments to zero, then go through the 20 segments separately.

An example of generating training data is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  train_data = [i for i in range(20)]
  for batch in tl.iterate.ptb_iterator(train_data, batch_size=2, num_steps=3):
      x, y = batch

Loss and update expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cost function is the average cost of each mini-batch:

.. code-block:: python

  # See tensorlayer.cost.cross_entropy_seq() for more details
  def loss_fn(outputs, targets, batch_size, num_steps):
      # Returns the cost function of Cross-entropy of two sequences, implement
      # softmax internally.
      # outputs : 2D tensor [batch_size*num_steps, n_units of output layer]
      # targets : 2D tensor [batch_size, num_steps], need to be reshaped.
      # n_examples = batch_size * num_steps
      # so
      # cost is the average cost of each mini-batch (concurrent process).
      loss = tf.nn.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example(
          [outputs],
          [tf.reshape(targets, [-1])],
          [tf.ones([batch_size * num_steps])])
      cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / batch_size
      return cost

  # Cost for Training
  cost = loss_fn(network.outputs, targets, batch_size, num_steps)


For updating, truncated backpropagation clips values of gradients by the ratio of the sum of
their norms, so as to make the learning process tractable.

.. code-block:: python

  # Truncated Backpropagation for training
  with tf.variable_scope('learning_rate'):
      lr = tf.Variable(0.0, trainable=False)
  tvars = tf.trainable_variables()
  grads, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(tf.gradients(cost, tvars),
                                    max_grad_norm)
  optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(lr)
  train_op = optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, tvars))


In addition, if the epoch index is greater than ``max_epoch``, we decrease the learning rate
by multipling ``lr_decay``.

.. code-block:: python

  new_lr_decay = lr_decay ** max(i - max_epoch, 0.0)
  sess.run(tf.assign(lr, learning_rate * new_lr_decay))


At the beginning of each epoch, all states of LSTMs need to be reseted
(initialized) to zero states. Then after each iteration, the LSTMs' states
is updated, so the new LSTM states (final states) need to be assigned as the initial states of the next iteration:

.. code-block:: python

  # set all states to zero states at the beginning of each epoch
  state1 = tl.layers.initialize_rnn_state(lstm1.initial_state)
  state2 = tl.layers.initialize_rnn_state(lstm2.initial_state)
  for step, (x, y) in enumerate(tl.iterate.ptb_iterator(train_data,
                                              batch_size, num_steps)):
      feed_dict = {input_data: x, targets: y,
                  lstm1.initial_state: state1,
                  lstm2.initial_state: state2,
                  }
      # For training, enable dropout
      feed_dict.update( network.all_drop )
      # use the new states as the initial state of next iteration
      _cost, state1, state2, _ = sess.run([cost,
                                      lstm1.final_state,
                                      lstm2.final_state,
                                      train_op],
                                      feed_dict=feed_dict
                                      )
      costs += _cost; iters += num_steps

Predicting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After training the model, when we predict the next output, we no long consider
the number of steps (sequence length), i.e. ``batch_size, num_steps`` are set to ``1``.
Then we can output the next word one by one, instead of predicting a sequence
of words from a sequence of words.

.. code-block:: python

  input_data_test = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [1, 1])
  targets_test = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [1, 1])
  ...
  network_test, lstm1_test, lstm2_test = inference(input_data_test,
                        is_training=False, num_steps=1, reuse=True)
  ...
  cost_test = loss_fn(network_test.outputs, targets_test, 1, 1)
  ...
  print("Evaluation")
  # Testing
  # go through the test set step by step, it will take a while.
  start_time = time.time()
  costs = 0.0; iters = 0
  # reset all states at the beginning
  state1 = tl.layers.initialize_rnn_state(lstm1_test.initial_state)
  state2 = tl.layers.initialize_rnn_state(lstm2_test.initial_state)
  for step, (x, y) in enumerate(tl.iterate.ptb_iterator(test_data,
                                          batch_size=1, num_steps=1)):
      feed_dict = {input_data_test: x, targets_test: y,
                  lstm1_test.initial_state: state1,
                  lstm2_test.initial_state: state2,
                  }
      _cost, state1, state2 = sess.run([cost_test,
                                      lstm1_test.final_state,
                                      lstm2_test.final_state],
                                      feed_dict=feed_dict
                                      )
      costs += _cost; iters += 1
  test_perplexity = np.exp(costs / iters)
  print("Test Perplexity: %.3f took %.2fs" % (test_perplexity, time.time() - start_time))



What Next?
-----------

Now, you have understood Synced sequence input and output. Let's think about
Many to one (Sequence input and one output), so that LSTM is able to predict
the next word "English" from "I am from London, I speak ..".

Please read and understand the code of ``tutorial_generate_text.py``.
It shows you how to restore a pre-trained Embedding matrix and how to learn text
generation from a given context.

Karpathy's blog :
"(3) Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is
classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment). "

    Or, le Centre Brennan considère cette dernière comme un mythe, affirmant que la fraude électorale est plus rare aux États-Unis que le nombre de personnes tuées par la foudre.


  After downloading the dataset, it start to create vocabulary files,
  ``vocab40000.fr`` and ``vocab40000.en`` from the training data ``giga-fren.release2.fr``
  and ``giga-fren.release2.en``, usually it will take a while. The number ``40000``
  reflects the vocabulary size.

  After training the model for 350000 steps, you can play with the translation by switch
  ``main_train()`` to ``main_decode()``. You type in a English sentence, the program will outputs
  a French sentence.

  Understand Translation
  ======================

  Seq2seq
  ---------

  Sequence to sequence model is commonly be used to translate a language to another.
  Actually, it can do many thing you can't imagine, we can translate
  a long sentence into short and simple sentence, for example, translation going
  from Shakespeare to modern English.
  With CNN, we can also translate a video into a sentence, i.e. video captioning.

  If you just want to use Seq2seq but not going to design a new algorithm, the
  only think you need to consider is the data format including how to split
  the words, how to tokenize the words etc.
  In this tutorial, we described a lot about data formating.



  Basics
  ^^^^^^

  Sequence to sequence model is a type of "Many to many" but different with Synced
  sequence input and output in PTB tutorial. Seq2seq generates sequence output
  after feeding all sequence inputs. The following two methods can improve the
  accuracy:
   - Reversing the inputs
   - Attention mechanism

  To speed up the computation, we used:

   - Sampled softmax

  Karpathy's blog described Seq2seq as:
  "(4) Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN
  reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French)."

  .. _fig_0601:

  .. image:: my_figs/basic_seq2seq.png
    :width: 100 %
    :align: center

  As the above figure shows, the encoder inputs, decoder inputs and targets are:

  .. code-block:: text

     encoder_input =  A    B    C
     decoder_input =  <go> W    X    Y    Z
     targets       =  W    X    Y    Z    <eos>

     Note: in the code, the size of targets is one smaller than the size
     of decoder_input, not like this figure. More details will be show later.

  Papers
  ^^^^^^^^

  The English-to-French example implements a multi-layer recurrent neural
  network as encoder, and an Attention-based decoder.
  It is the same as the model described in this paper:
   - `Grammar as a Foreign Language <http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449>`_

  The example uses sampled softmax to handle large output vocabulary size.
  In this example, as ``target_vocab_size=4000``, for vocabularies smaller
  than ``512``, it might be a better idea to just use a standard softmax loss.
  Sampled softmax is described in Section 3 of the this paper:
   - `On Using Very Large Target Vocabulary for Neural Machine Translation <http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2007>`_

  Reversing the inputs and Multi-layer cells have been successfully used in
  sequence-to-sequence models for translation has beed described in this paper:
   - `Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`_

  Attention mechanism allows the decoder more direct access to the input, it was
  described in this paper:
   - `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`_

  Alternatively, the model can also be implemented by a single-layer
  version, but with Bi-directional encoder, was presented in this paper:
   - `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`_



  Implementation
  ---------------

  Bucketing and Padding
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  (Note that, TensorLayer supports Dynamic RNN layer after v1.2, so bucketing is not longer necessary in many cases)

  Bucketing is a method to efficiently handle sentences of different length.
  When translating English to French, we will have English sentences of
  different lengths ``L1`` on input, and French sentences of different
  lengths ``L2`` on output. We should in principle create a seq2seq model
  for every pair ``(L1, L2+1)`` (prefixed by a GO symbol) of
  lengths of an English and French sentence.

  To minimize the number of buckets and find the closest bucket for each pair, then we could just pad every
  sentence with a special PAD symbol in the end if the bucket is bigger
  than the sentence

  We use a number of buckets and pad to the closest one for efficiency.
  In this example, we used 4 buckets as follow.

  .. code-block:: python

    buckets = [(5, 10), (10, 15), (20, 25), (40, 50)]

  If the input is an English sentence with ``3`` tokens and the corresponding
  output is a French sentence with ``6`` tokens, then they will be put in the
  first bucket and padded to length ``5`` for encoder inputs (English sentence),
  and length ``10`` for decoder inputs.
  If we have an English sentence with 8 tokens and the corresponding French
  sentence has 18 tokens, then they will be fit into ``(20, 25)`` bucket.

  In other word, bucket ``(I, O)`` is ``(encoder_input_size, decoder_inputs_size)``.

  Given a pair of ``[["I", "go", "."], ["Je", "vais", "."]]`` in tokenized format,
  we fit it into bucket ``(5, 10)``.
  The training data of encoder inputs representing ``[PAD PAD "." "go" "I"]``
  and decoder inputs ``[GO "Je" "vais" "." EOS PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD]``. The targets
  are decoder inputs shifted by one. The ``target_weights`` is the mask of
  ``targets``.


  .. code-block:: text

    bucket = (I, O) = (5, 10)
    encoder_inputs = [PAD PAD "." "go" "I"]                       <-- 5  x batch_size
    decoder_inputs = [GO "Je" "vais" "." EOS PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD] <-- 10 x batch_size
    target_weights = [1   1     1     1   0 0 0 0 0 0 0]          <-- 10 x batch_size
    targets        = ["Je" "vais" "." EOS PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD]    <-- 9  x batch_size


  In this example, one sentence is represented by one column, so assume
  ``batch_size = 3``, ``bucket = (5, 10)`` the training data will look like:

  .. code-block:: text

    encoder_inputs    decoder_inputs    target_weights    targets
    0    0    0       1    1    1       1    1    1       87   71   16748
    0    0    0       87   71   16748   1    1    1       2    3    14195
    0    0    0       2    3    14195   0    1    1       0    2    2
    0    0    3233    0    2    2       0    0    0       0    0    0
    3    698  4061    0    0    0       0    0    0       0    0    0
                      0    0    0       0    0    0       0    0    0
                      0    0    0       0    0    0       0    0    0
                      0    0    0       0    0    0       0    0    0
                      0    0    0       0    0    0       0    0    0
                      0    0    0       0    0    0

    where 0 : _PAD    1 : _GO     2 : _EOS      3 : _UNK

  During training, the decoder inputs are the targets, while
  during prediction, the next decoder input is the last decoder output.


  Special vocabulary symbols, punctuations and digits
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The special vocabulary symbols in this example are:

  .. code-block:: python

    _PAD = b"_PAD"
    _GO = b"_GO"
    _EOS = b"_EOS"
    _UNK = b"_UNK"
    PAD_ID = 0      <-- index (row number) in vocabulary
    GO_ID = 1
    EOS_ID = 2
    UNK_ID = 3
    _START_VOCAB = [_PAD, _GO, _EOS, _UNK]

  .. code-block:: text

            ID    MEANINGS
    _PAD    0     Padding, empty word
    _GO     1     1st element of decoder_inputs
    _EOS    2     End of Sentence of targets
    _UNK    3     Unknown word, words do not exist in vocabulary will be marked as 3


  For digits, the ``normalize_digits`` of creating vocabularies and tokenized dataset
  must be consistent, if ``normalize_digits=True`` all digits will be replaced by ``0``. Like
  ``123`` to ``000```, `9` to `0` and `1990-05` to `0000-00`, then `000`, `0` and
  `0000-00` etc will be the words in the vocabulary (see ``vocab40000.en``).

  Otherwise, if ``normalize_digits=False``, different digits
  will be seem in the vocabulary, then the vocabulary size will be very big.
  The regular expression to find digits is ``_DIGIT_RE = re.compile(br"\d")``.
  (see ``tl.nlp.create_vocabulary()`` and ``tl.nlp.data_to_token_ids()``)

  For word split, the regular expression is
  ``_WORD_SPLIT = re.compile(b"([.,!?\"':;)(])")``, this means use the symbols like
  ``[ . , ! ? " ' : ; ) ( ]`` and space to split the sentence, see
  ``tl.nlp.basic_tokenizer()`` which is the default tokenizer of
  ``tl.nlp.create_vocabulary()`` and ``tl.nlp.data_to_token_ids()``.


  All punctuation marks, such as ``. , ) (`` are all reserved in the vocabularies
  of both English and French.



  Sampled softmax
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Sampled softmax is a method to reduce the computation of cost so as to
  handle large output vocabulary. Instead of compute the cross-entropy of large
  output, we compute the loss from samples of ``num_samples``.


  Dataset iteration
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The iteration is done by ``EmbeddingAttentionSeq2seqWrapper.get_batch``, which get a random batch of data
  from the specified bucket, prepare for step. The data


  Loss and update expressions
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The ``EmbeddingAttentionSeq2seqWrapper`` has built in SGD optimizer.
