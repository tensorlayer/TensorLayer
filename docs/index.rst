**Good News:** We won the **Best Open Source Software Award** `@ACM Multimedia (MM) 2017 <http://www.acmmm.org/2017/mm-2017-awardees/>`_.

`TensorLayer`_ is a Deep Learning (DL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) library extended from `Google TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_.  It provides popular DL and RL modules that can be easily customized and assembled for tackling real-world machine learning problems.
More details can be found `here <https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer>`_.

.. note::
   If you got problem to read the docs online, you could download the repository
   on `GitHub`_, then go to ``/docs/_build/html/index.html`` to read the docs
   offline. The ``_build`` folder can be generated in ``docs`` using ``make html``.
