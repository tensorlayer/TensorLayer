`TensorLayer`_ is a Deep Learning (DL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) library extended from `Google TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_.  It provides popular DL and RL modules that can be easily customized and assembled for tackling real-world machine learning problems.

.. note::
   If you got problem to read the docs online, you could download the repository
   on `GitHub`_, then go to ``/docs/_build/html/index.html`` to read the docs
   offline. The ``_build`` folder can be generated in ``docs`` using ``make html``.

User Guide
------------

The TensorLayer user guide explains how to install TensorFlow, CUDA and cuDNN,
how to build and train neural networks using TensorLayer, and how to contribute
to the library as a developer.
