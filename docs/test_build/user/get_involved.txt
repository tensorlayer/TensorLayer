Data Science Institute, Imperial College London
===============================================

Data science is therefore by nature at the core of all modern
transdisciplinary scientific activities, as it involves the whole life
cycle of data, from acquisition and exploration to analysis and
communication of the results. Data science is not only concerned with
the tools and methods to obtain, manage and analyse data: it is also
about extracting value from data and translating it from asset to
product.

Launched on 1st April 2014, the Data Science Institute at Imperial
College London aims to enhance Imperial's excellence in data-driven
research across its faculties by fulfilling the following objectives.

The Data Science Institute is housed in purpose built facilities in
the heart of the Imperial College campus in South Kensington. Such a
central location provides excellent access to collabroators across the
College and across London.
