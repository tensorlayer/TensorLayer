# Contributing to TensorLayer

We appreciate contributions
either by adding / improving examples or extending / fixing the core library. 
To make your contributions, you would need to follow the [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding style and [numpydoc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt) document style.
We rely on Continuous Integration (CI) through development.
The following tools are used to ensure that your PR can pass through the CI test:

* yapf (format code)
* isort (sort imports)
* autoflake (remove unused imports)

Please apply these tools in the changed files before submitting your PR.
