# OpenPose using TensorFlow and TensorLayer

## 1. Motivation

Ok, CMU provides OpenPose for real-time 2D pose estimation. However, the training code is based on Caffe and C++, which is hard to customize.
While in practice, developers need to customize their training set, data augmentation methods according to their projects.
In addition, the speed of original model in the paper can be improved.
Therefore, we xxxxx

## 2. Project files

- `models.py` is to define the model structures, e.g. VGG19, Residual Squeezenet
- `data_process.py` is to 
- `train.py` is to train the model
- ....

## 3. Preparation

To have a fast inferecning, the pose-processing for inferencing is based on OpenPose's C++ implmentation, so before you run the inferencing code, 
you should compile ...

## 4. Use pre-trained model

Runs `xxx.py`, it will automatically download the default VGG19-based model from [here](https://github.com/tensorlayer/pretrained-models), 
and use it for inferencing.
The performance of pre-trained model is as follow:

|             	| Speed      	| AP      	| xxx |
|-------------	|---------------	|---------------	|---------------	|
| VGG19 	| xx	| xx	| xx 	| 
| Residual Squeeze  	| xx	| xx 	| xx 	| 

- Speed is tested on XXX

## 5. Train a model

Runs `train.py`, it will automatically download MSCOCO 2017 dataset into `dataset/coco17`. 
The default model in `models.py` is based on VGG19, which is the same with the original paper. 
If you want to customize the model, simply change it in `models.py`.
And then `train.py` will train the model to the end.

## 6. Evaluate a model

Runs `xxx.py`, the API `xxxxx` is ....

## 7. Speed up and deployment

For TensorRT float16 (half-float) inferencing, xxx

## 8. Customization
- Model : change `models.py`.
- Data augmentation : ....
- Train with your own data: ....  
    - 1) prepare your data following MSCOCO format, you need to ...
    - 2) concatenate the list of your own data JSON into ...
- Evaluate on your own testing set:
    - 1) xx
