<!--

============== Guiding Principles ==============

* Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
* There should be an entry for every single version.
* The same types of changes should be grouped.
* Versions and sections should be linkable.
* The latest version comes first.
* The release date of each version is displayed.
* Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

============== Types of changes (keep the order) ==============

* `Added` for new features.
* `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
* `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
* `Removed` for now removed features.
* `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
* `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
* `Dependencies Update` in case of vulnerabilities.
* `Contributors` to thank the contributors that worked on this PR.

============== How To Update The Changelog for a New Release ==============

** Always Keep The Unreleased On Top **

To release a new version, please update the changelog as followed:
1. Rename the `Unreleased` Section to the Section Number
2. Recreate an `Unreleased` Section on top
3. Update the links at the very bottom
